# Sheena Easton and Total Conflict

Sheena Easton describes the following scenario for her baby:

- Takes the morning train
- Works from nine 'til five
- Takes another train home again
- Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

--

Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a **zero-sum (total conflict)** game.

- Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern), or "matching pennies."
- Useful for modeling strategic counterterrorism dilemmas between a government and terrorist group.

# A Total Conflict Between Sheena Easton and Her Baby

|                         | Sheena Easton Stays Home       | Sheena Easton Goes to Baby's Work |
|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Baby Home Again**          |  -100, **100**         |  **100**, 0       |
| **Baby Stays at Work**             |   **50**, 0        |  -100, **100**        |

Notice we have no pure strategies, and no Nash equilibrium.

- Sheena Easton wants to proverbially "match pennies."
- Her baby has diametrically opposed preferences, fearing for his safety.

Solution: mixed strategy.

# Congressman Astley's Re-election Platform

Assume Congressman Astley presides over a competitive district in which he seeks reappointment. He promises he's:

- Never gonna give you up.
- Never gonna let you down.
- Never gonna run around and desert you.
- Never gonna make you cry.
- Never gonna say goodbye.
- Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Are these promises (if credible) sufficient to secure re-election?
